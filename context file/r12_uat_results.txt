### Defect Summary
- **Critical:** 0
- **High:** 2
- **Medium:** 5
- **Low:** 3

### Recommendation
Based on the UAT execution results, the Finzo platform is recommended for CONDITIONAL APPROVAL. The platform demonstrates readiness in core functionality areas with no critical defects identified. However, two high-priority issues must be resolved and verified before production deployment. The medium and low-priority issues can be addressed in a subsequent patch release within two weeks of the initial deployment.

### Final Recommendation

Based on UAT results, we recommend CONDITIONAL APPROVAL of the Finzo platform for production deployment. The platform successfully passed 88% of test scenarios, including all critical functionality required for day-to-day operations. 

**Conditions for Deployment:**
1. High-priority defects (FIN-HIGH-01 and FIN-HIGH-02) must be fixed and verified before go-live
2. A release plan for addressing medium-priority defects within two weeks of deployment must be approved
3. Training materials should include known issues and workarounds

The platform demonstrates strong core functionality with excellent security and performance characteristics. The financial calculation accuracy (except for the identified split calculation issue) has been verified by domain experts and meets requirements. User feedback during testing was generally positive, with testers able to complete key tasks efficiently.

Recommended go-live date: June 10, 2023, contingent upon verification of high-priority defect fixes.
